Configuring ambient mesh with Istio is easy, but it's not easy to get it right. This post will walk you through the process of setting up a simple ambient mesh with Istio and Gateway API.

## Why ambient mesh and not sidecar?

Ambient mesh uses a shared agent on each Kubernetes node, called a ***ztunnel***. This zero-trust tunnel securely connects and authenticates elements within the mesh, redirecting all traffic through the local ztunnel agent.

This separation allows operators to manage the data plane independently from applications, enabling easier scaling and upgrades.

Ztunnels provide core service mesh functions: zero trust, mTLS, telemetry, authentication, and L4 authorization, without parsing HTTP.

In comparison, ztunnel doesn't perform L7 processing, making it leaner than sidecars and suitable as shared infrastructure. The traditional sidecar, which has been a staple of Istio for years, now faces a significant competitor. This new contender challenges the long-standing dominance of the sidecar model, introducing innovative approaches and technologies that promise to enhance performance, security, and overall efficiency in service mesh architectures.

## Pre-requisites

This post assumes you already have istio set up in `ambient` mode. In case you don't, this will get you up and running in two minutes:

```yaml
helm repo add istio https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts --force-update

helm install -n istio-system istio-base istio/base --create-namespace
helm install -n istio-system istio-cni istio/cni --set profile=ambient
helm install -n istio-system istiod istio/istiod --set profile=ambient
helm install -n istio-system ztunnel istio/ztunnel
helm install -n istio-ingress istio-ingress istio/gateway --create-namespace

kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null || { kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v1.1.0" | kubectl apply -f -; }
```

## The `Gateway`

The Gateway API simplifies the configuration of ingress and egress traffic, providing a unified approach to managing traffic routing within the mesh. This helps in maintaining a clear and manageable structure for directing traffic to the appropriate services.

### Setting Up the Gateway

To set up the Gateway, you need to create a `Gateway` resource that defines how traffic enters the mesh.

<Markdown variant="note" category="istio" name="gateway" expanded={true} />

### Labeling the Namespace

<Callout variant="warning" message="If you do not label your namespace(s) to match the selector above your routes will not be added!" />

Next, label the namespace that will host your internal services to allow the Gateway to route traffic to them. 

This is a crucial step which tells istio to look for `HTTPRoute` objects in this namespace.

```bash
kubectl label ns internal-services gateway-internal-access=true
```

## Create `HTTPRoute` Objects

Create `HTTPRoute` resources to define how traffic should be routed to your services. Here's an example for two different services:

### Tool A

Define an `HTTPRoute` for `tool-a`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: tool-a
  namespace: internal-services
spec:
  hostnames:
  - "tool-a.matthewdavis.io"
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway
    namespace: ingress-internal
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: tool-a
      port: 8080
```

### Tool B

Define an `HTTPRoute` for `tool-b`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: tool-b
  namespace: internal-services
spec:
  hostnames:
  - "tool-b.matthewdavis.io"
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway
    namespace: ingress-internal
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: tool-b
      port: 9090
```
